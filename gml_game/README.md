# Overview

Impact is a game that I made made for having fun with your friend. It is a 2 player game where 2 players duel. 1 keyboard is used to play. P1 controls his character with WASD to move and TAB to shoot his weapon.
P2 controls his character with the directional arrows to move and SPACE to shoot his weapon.

I built this game, because I grew up playing video games with my brothers, and I now have younger brothers who are growing up. I figured this game would be a fun way to connect with them. Some of my fondest
memories are those of playing Halo with my brothers. It wasn't just playing the game that was special, but it was playing with them that was special. For this, I created a multiplayer game that could be played 
on the same system using the same keyboard.

# Development Environment
To develop this game I used the GameMaker 2.0 IDE. This is a game engine that is popular amongst the indie game development community. It is especially good for making 2D games.

The GameMaker engine uses its own dedicated language called *GML* or GameMaker Language. This language is easy to understand. While learning, I felt like I was learning Python all over again. It was fairly
simple to pick up the language. Because I wanted to code more than create art, I sourced free open source 2D art and sprites to use in my game. I sourced these assets from [itch.io](itch.io)

* Add a scoreboard.
* Add the ability to respawn.
* Fix firing animation.
* Fix bug that causes all instances of a bullet to delete if one has collision with a player.
