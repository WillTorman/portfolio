# Overview
This program is a calculator for the total hours one works in a week. I work construction and I wanted to automate the calculation of how many hours I work each day and each week. To automate this process, I made this Hours Calculator.

The user will input their start and end time. The program will then calculate how many hours were worked that day. The program will then allow the user to save the hours recorded. Once all hours have been recorded for each pay period, the user can then know their total hours worked. This will make it easier for them to send correct hours to their boss.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio to write this program, because it is the official IDE of the Kotlin language. It is also similar to JetBrains Rider which is an IDE I have used for working with C# code.

The language used to create this Android app is Kotlin.

# Future Work

- *Store times* for a week. I would like to save the recorded hours so that an entire week can be stored.
- *Handle edge cases* depending on start and stop time, you may get a faulty result, because the app is designed to use military time.
- *Handle different data types* the user might input. If they type a string rather than an int/double, I don't want the app to crash.
