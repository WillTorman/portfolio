# Overview

This is a web page to I created to show some of my favorite personal coding projects. I made this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I chose these languages and to write this program, because I have used HTML and CSS before, and I wanted to learn more about JavaScript. When you examine the code used for the slides you can see some basic loops and logic used for user interaction.
