# Overview

This program is a calculator for the total hours one works in a week. I work construction and I wanted to automate the calculation of how many hours I work each day and each week. To automate this process, I made this `Hours Calculator`.

The user will input their start and end time. The program will then calculate how many hours were worked that day. The program will then allow the user to save the hours recorded. Once all hours have been recorded for each pay period, the user can then know their total hours worked. This will make it easier for them to send correct hours to their boss.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
I used Microsoft's Visual Studio to write this program, because it is the IDE that I feel works best for C++ programming.

To write this program, I used the C++ programming language. I chose this language, because it is quick and a language that I desire to learn.
